# MatebutePCOptimizer
Optimizer I made back when I was 7. Really just a fancy script.

Flagged as malware by many antivirus softwares, I have no idea why but it's probably because of a feature called "FixItNow" that shows an annoying pop-up every hour and tries to free RAM by running mystring=(80000000) periodically which is just crap so please don't turn it on.

It's written in BATCH, as that was the only language I knew about (didn't have access to the internet, just CMD's help command on my slow-asf Windows XP machine)

Some files might be zipped onto an executable .zip, just decompress them and you can access the batch code.

Includes various registry tweaks and removes some bloat. I made it specifically for my Windows XP machine, but it worked wonderfully on my grandpa's Windows 7 machine. Either way... if you're gonna run it, do it on a virtual machine or something.
