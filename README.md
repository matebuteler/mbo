Optimizer I made when I was 7. Really just a fancy script.

Flagged as malware by many antivirus softwares, I have no idea why but it's probably because of a feature called "FixItNow" that shows an annoying pop-up every hour and tries to free RAM.

It's written in BATCH, as that was the only language I knew about (didn't have access to the internet, just CMD's help command on my slow-asf windows XP machine)

Some files might be zipped onto an executable .zip, just decompress them and you can access the batch code.
